# 3D VISION Of OBJ File With MESHWALKER Model
The 3D_VISION with MESHWALKER Model is an advanced computer vision model that focuses on 3D object recognition and understanding. It combines the power of 3D computer vision techniques with the effectiveness of the MESHWALKER model to provide accurate and detailed analysis of 3D scenes and objects.

This repository contains the implementation of the 3D_VISION with MESHWALKER Model, along with relevant documentation and examples to help you understand and utilize the model effectively.

## Features :

- 3D Object Recognition: The model is designed to accurately recognize and classify 3D objects in a given scene.

- Scene Understanding: It provides a deeper understanding of the 3D scene by analyzing the spatial relationships and interactions between objects.

- Robust Performance: The model is trained on large-scale datasets and has been fine-tuned to perform with high accuracy and robustness.

- MESHWALKER Integration: MESHWALKER, a powerful model for 3D mesh analysis, is integrated into the system to enhance the quality of analysis and provide detailed 
  insights.
